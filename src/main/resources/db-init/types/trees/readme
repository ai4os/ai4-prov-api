This tree directory structure is used to generate all provenance variants
Here is where all of the provenance RML maps will be stored

Each extension has to include 2 files:
-> content.ttl : actual content of the RML that has to be included in the father
RML (probably this will be tags that describe the elements of that provenance source)

-> origin: a key value pair separated by a colon like "mlflow:MLflow". This is needed
to link different sources with other sources during RML mapping...

(OPTIONAL)
-> bridge.ttl: this should include the link between the core RML and the extension

The last tag/element of the core RML RDF should be the one where this bridges will be written
(the one which will be linked with the extensions that has bridges.ttl defined)

(IMPORTANT)
An extension could have no bridge that does not matter. It just means that the element
wont be linked with the core RML main entity/tag. However, because every extension has a origin
they will be linked to the root agent (organization agent (probably AI4EOSC)) of the core RML.
This link will be defined somewhere in <extension>/content.ttl
